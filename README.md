## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned


Using @media to change what is shown on the screen according to the size is the most notable thing I learned in this project

```css
@media (min-width: 620px) {
    .container {
        width: 600px;
        height: 450px;
        display: flex; 
        margin: 175px auto 75px;   
    }
}
```
### Continued development

What is to come is to incorporate JavaScript to give dynamism to the pages

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/@CodingTube) - This is a great resource, it explains very well, but be careful, it is not about just copying the code, you must be attentive and learn each step and always code with your own style.
